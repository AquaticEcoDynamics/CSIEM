This is the repository for relevant **data, models and documentation** for Cockburn Sound, developed as part of the WAMSI-Westport Marine Science Program.

## Cloning the repo with all submodule code/files

A basic clone will not include the code in the submodules so an extra argument is needed `--recurse-submodules`

### Cloning the latest bundle
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/CSIEM.git
```

### Cloning a particular tag
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -b v1.1.0 https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/CSIEM.git
```

## Archiving all code/files

If you want to create an archive of all the code (including the submodules), first clone the repository as described above and zip entire repository.  The zip file can be uploaded to Zenodo to get a DOI.  An automated integration with Zenodo will not archive the code from the submodules.
